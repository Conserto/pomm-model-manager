Pomm's ModelManager package is the common model layer built upon the Foundation package. It makes developers able to query the database and get object oriented entities back.

This package is still in early development stage and should be available soon. If you want to use Pomm in production now, look at [Pomm 1.x](http://www.pomm-project.org).
